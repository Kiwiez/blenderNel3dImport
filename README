OVERVIEW: 
=======================

This is a very early version of an import script to import Nel 3d
(dev.ryzom.com) data files into Blender (www.blender.org).  The goal
is to be able to batch-import .shape, .skel, and .anim files.

The script is tested with Blender 2.62.


LICENSE: 
=======================

NeL 3D Blender Importer is licensed under the GNU GPL v.3. See the
file COPYING for details.


USAGE:
=======================

In its current state it is not an import plugin and can only be used
directly from the Blender script/text editor. You need to adjust the
global file name variables at the beginning of the file and
comment/uncomment the desired functionality at the end of the file.
Error and warning messages are ouput to the Blender console window.
See the source file (import_nel3d.py) for further details.
