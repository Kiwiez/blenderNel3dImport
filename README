OVERVIEW: 
=======================

This is a very early version of an import script to import Nel 3d
(dev.ryzom.com) data files into Blender (www.blender.org).  The goal
is to be able to batch-import .shape, .skel, and .anim files.

The script is developed/tested with Blender 2.63.

file COPYING for details.


USAGE:
=======================

Note: this plug-in is in a very early stage of development.

Blender Integration: to use it from the 'File->Import' menu copy the
script file 'import_nel3d.py' into your blender script add-on
directory (blender/2.63/scripts/addons) and activate it in the
user-preferences (Ctrl-Alt-u). In this mode it can currently only
import .shape files.

To use it from the script-editor open 'test.py' as a Blender
text node and adjust the global file name variables at the beginning
of the file and comment/uncomment the desired functionality at the end
of the file. To execute the script press (Alt-p). See the source files
for further details.

Error and warning messages are output to the Blender console window.
